# Customer Complaints Classification

## Problem Statement

In the dynamic landscape of customer support, efficient handling of customer complaints is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and loyalty. Our company has amassed a substantial amount of customer complaint data in JSON format. Unfortunately, this data is currently unlabelled, making it challenging to promptly route tickets to the appropriate departments for resolution.

To address this issue, we propose the implementation of a robust classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Objective

The goal is to create a model capable of automatically categorizing customer complaints into distinct clusters based on the products or services mentioned in the tickets. This classification will allow for streamlined ticket management, ensuring that each issue is directed to the relevant department for swift and effective resolution.

## Classify Tickets into Five Clusters

- **Credit card / Prepaid card**
- **Bank account services**
- **Theft/Dispute reporting**
- **Mortgages/loans**
- **Others**
